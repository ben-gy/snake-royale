/**
 * noticeboard.ts — a list of open public rooms, with no server.
 *
 * There is no backend to hold a lobby list, so the rooms advertise themselves.
 * Every peer that cares joins ONE well-known extra room per game (roomId
 * `__board`) and hosts of public rooms announce `{code, host, players, …}` into
 * it every couple of seconds. Browsers listen and render whatever is still
 * fresh. Entries expire on silence, so a host that closes its tab simply falls
 * off the list — nothing to clean up, and no stale rooms to click into.
 *
 *   const board = createNoticeboard({ appId: 'my-slug', onRooms: render });
 *   board.announce({ code, host: name, players: 2, max: 6, playing: false });
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * READ THIS BEFORE USING IT: the noticeboard has a privacy cost that a private
 * room does not.
 *
 * This is WebRTC. Connecting to a peer means exchanging ICE candidates, which
 * carry IP addresses. In a private room that is fine — you invited those people.
 * The noticeboard is a room full of STRANGERS, so both listing a public game and
 * browsing the list expose your IP to everyone else doing the same.
 *
 * So: it must be opt-in on both sides, and say so where the player opts in.
 * Never join the board just because someone opened the game — a player who only
 * ever plays with friends should never touch it. Private rooms must not announce
 * at all; that is the whole distinction between public and private here.
 *
 * The second cost is shape: Trystero builds a FULL MESH, so N browsers on the
 * board is N² connections. Fine for a handful, not for a crowd — `maxPeers`
 * gives up and reports the board as full rather than melting a phone.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Copied from the gh-game-factory patterns/ engine, unchanged.
