/**
 * rematch.ts — multi-round sessions inside ONE living P2P room.
 *
 * The problem this exists to solve: the obvious way to write "Play again" is to
 * leave the room and rejoin it. That is a trap. Trystero memoizes joinRoom on
 * appId+roomId while room.leave() defers its teardown ~99ms, so a same-tick
 * rejoin aliases the dying room: no relay subscription, no announce loop, an
 * empty peer map. Every peer then elects ITSELF host and sits alone in a room
 * with the right code. It is deterministic, it is permanent, and it looks
 * exactly like "we're both the host and can't see each other".
 *
 * So: never leave. Keep one Net for the room's whole life and version the
 * rounds inside it. This module owns that protocol.
 *
 *   const rounds = createRounds({ net, playerName, minPlayers: 2,
 *     onRound: ({ round, seed, players, isHost }) => startGame(...) });
 *
 *   rounds.vote();          // "I'm ready" / "Play again"
 *   rounds.unvote();        // backed out
 *   rounds.go();            // host only: start now with whoever has voted
 *   rounds.state();         // { round, phase, votes, canStart, ... } for rendering
 *
 * Two properties everything else depends on:
 *
 *  1. THE ROSTER TRAVELS WITH THE START. The host freezes {id,name}[] into the
 *     start message, so every peer builds identical player indices from the same
 *     bytes. Deriving the roster locally (the old 'go' carried only a seed) lets
 *     two peers disagree about who is player 0 — scores land on the wrong name.
 *
 *  2. ROUNDS ARE NUMBERED AND MONOTONIC. A start for a round we have already
 *     played is ignored, so a duplicate or late-delivered start cannot restart a
 *     live game, and two peers pressing at once cannot double-fire.
 *
 * Copied from the gh-game-factory patterns/ engine. In Snake Royale a "round" is
 * one arena from countdown to last-snake-standing; the frozen roster it hands to
 * onRound IS the seating (roster index N = snake N on every peer).
