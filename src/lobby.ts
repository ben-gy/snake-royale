 * lobby.ts — a drop-in peer-to-peer lobby built on net.ts + rematch.ts. Copied

 *
 * This file is a VIEW. It owns no protocol: presence, readiness, quorum, the
 * shared seed and the frozen roster all come from rematch.ts, so starting the
 * first arena and starting a rematch are the same code path. It used to run its

 * carried a seed but no roster, leaving peers free to disagree about which snake
 * was whose. It also leaked those three receivers on destroy().
